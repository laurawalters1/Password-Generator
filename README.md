# Password-Generator

This application acts as a random password generator, that allows the user to select password length, and the character types it will include, the application then takes the user input and uses it to define an array from which random characters will be selected and used to generate a password. If the user selects an incompatible password length, or fails to select any character type, the application will return an alert message to the user, describing what they need to do differently to successfully generate a password.
